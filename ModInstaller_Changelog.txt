1.2
- Added an auto updater (Thanks SuperSonic16!)
- Made it even more user friendly, with a better GUI (?)

- Bug Fixes.


1.0.3
- Changed the format from EXE to BAT to eliminate problems with Antivirus software. It should now be
usable by everyone.
- Update filenames (data.txt)
- Included a "UninstallMods.bat" that automatically replaces Data.rsdk with the one
from the backup folder.
- Updated the Installer fininshing dialog to mention "UninstallMods.bat"
- Added colors to BackupRSDK.bat
- Muted several dialogs and prints to simplify the tool
- Changed backup folder name.
- There will no longe be a data folder remaining in your Mods folder after you install mods.

NOTE: If you backed up your RSDK file before, please move your backup into the new folder.
How to do it:
1 - Create a folder called "_rsdkbackup"
2 - Move "data.rsdk" from the backup folder to the newly create folder.
