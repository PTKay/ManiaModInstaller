This mod installer extracts, installs the mods, and repacks Data.rsdk using RSDKPack automaticaly, 
making mod instalation much easier.

The mods should all go to the Mods directory, each one with their own subfolder (named without spaces).
This release comes pre-packaged with the SaturnUI, the PlaystationUI, the Sonic Discovery title screen mod, and the
best Mania mod of all times.

Intructions:
1 - Paste the contents of this zip into the game folder
2 - Run "BackupRSDK.bat" (only needed for the first time)
3 - Paste mods in the Mods folder
4 - Run "ModInstaller.bat"
5 - When asked, type the name of the mod you want to install
5.1 - There will be 3 prompts asking you what mods you want to install, meaning
you can install 3 mods at a time each time you open the program. If you want to
install more, just reopen ModInstaller.bat
6 - Wait until the mods are installed, and enjoy!
PS: If at the end, the installer hangs when you already pressed any key, just wait a bit and it'll close!


Mod folders cannot have spaces in their names (again). If they do, then enter the
name of the mod between "" (not tested, but should work).

There will probably be updated for the ManiaModInstaller, so please
follow/check @PTKickass on Twitter for updates on the tool!


NOTE: If you backed up your RSDK file before on the previous version of the ManiaModInstaller, 
please move your backup to the new backup folder.
How to do it:
1 - Create a folder called "_rsdkbackup"
2 - Move "data.rsdk" from the backup folder to the newly create folder.
